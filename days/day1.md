### **Sentence 1: I need to cut down on coffee because I'm not sleeping well.**

* **Phrasal Verb:** `to cut down on (something)` means to reduce the amount of it you use or consume. It's often used for habits or food.
    * *Example: "I'm trying to **cut down on** sugar."*
* **Grammar:** This sentence uses `need to` to show something is necessary. The word `because` connects the action (cutting down on coffee) to the reason (not sleeping well). The phrase `I'm not sleeping` is in the present continuous tense, suggesting this is a current, ongoing problem.

### **Sentence 2: He ended up working late to finish the project.**

* **Phrasal Verb:** `to end up (doing something)` means to find yourself in a final situation that was often not planned. It describes the result of a series of events.
    * *Example: "We got lost and **ended up** on the wrong side of town."*
* **Grammar:** This is in the simple past tense (`ended`). The structure is `end up` + `verb-ing` (a gerund). So we say "ended up **working**," not "ended up to work."

### **Sentence 3: Could you look over my email before I send it?**

* **Phrasal Verb:** `to look over (something)` means to check or examine something quickly. It's less detailed than "to review" or "to proofread."
    * *Example: "Can you **look over** this report for any obvious mistakes?"*
* **Grammar:** `Could you...?` is a very polite and common way to ask for a favor. It is softer than "Can you...?" or "Will you...?".

### **Sentence 4: We need to figure out a time to meet next week.**

* **Phrasal Verb:** `to figure out (something)` means to solve a problem or understand something by thinking about it. It's very common in everyday conversation.
    * *Example: "I can't **figure out** how to use this new app."*
* **Grammar:** This sentence uses `need to` to express necessity. `to meet` is an infinitive that explains the purpose of the "time." We need a time *for the purpose of meeting*.

### **Sentence 5: She brought up a great idea during the meeting.**

* **Phrasal Verb:** `to bring up (something)` means to introduce a topic or subject into a conversation. `Brought` is the simple past tense of `bring`.
    * *Example: "Don't **bring up** politics at the dinner table."*
* **Grammar:** This is a simple past tense sentence, describing a single, completed action that happened in the past (`during the meeting`).
